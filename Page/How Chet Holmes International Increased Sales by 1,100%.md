# How Chet Holmes International Increased Sales by 1,100%

## From Traditional to Digital: A Game-Changing Marketing Transformation

When Amanda Holmes inherited the coaching empire, Chet Holmes International, she knew that modernizing the business was essential for future growth. Her vision? To create an entire marketing automation system from the ground up.

## The Challenge: Simplifying Digital Marketing Complexity

Most digital marketing software can feel overwhelming and complex, but Amanda found a solution that transformed her business.

> “Leadpages has taken what we had with a call center, what we had with radio ads, what we had with 3 different divisions, and made it automated and online. By a click of a button, I have control of all that.”

Within just five months of adopting [Leadpages](https://bit.ly/LEadPages), Amanda’s team fully embraced marketing automation, rebuilt their sales and marketing funnel, and achieved a staggering 1,100% increase in sales.

Here’s how Amanda Holmes and her team revolutionized their marketing approach with Leadpages:

### Key Strategies That Drove Success

- **Compelling Lead Magnets**  
  Amanda’s team developed a more targeted opt-in incentive: a series of videos that taught salespeople how to "get past any gatekeeper," among other enticing promises. This strategy was the foundation of their success.

- **Enticing Launch Funnels**  
  Leads were sent a sequence of three emails, each containing a link to a video hosted on a Leadpages landing page. These pages not only delivered the promised lead magnets but also encouraged visitors to share the content via Facebook, amplifying their reach.

- **Interactive Webinars**  
  After completing the video sequence, leads were invited to a sales webinar through a follow-up email. Thanks to the value provided upfront, 20% of recipients signed up for the webinar, and an impressive 73% attended.

- **High-Converting Sales Pages**  
  During and after the webinar, attendees were directed to focused sales pages offering a year-long membership to CHI’s sales training materials. Conversion rates averaged 12%, with recent campaigns reaching as high as 24%.

## How Does This Apply to Your Business?

> *“Yes, Leadpages did increase conversions. Yes, it increased our leads tenfold. But, ultimately for me, it gives me peace of mind.”*  

Amanda’s journey shows that even large, family-run businesses need to embrace digital transformation to thrive. Whether you’re a small startup or an established business, these lessons are universally valuable:

### Practical Steps for Your Marketing Success

- **Start Simple**  
  Instead of launching an e-commerce store for all CHI products or a massive video library, Amanda focused on building targeted landing pages with one clear goal in mind for each step of the sales process.

- **Create Content People Will Love**  
  Amanda noticed that her email open rates increased as her strategy evolved. Why? People were excited about the valuable lead-magnet content they received and wanted to see what else CHI had to offer.

- **Measure Your Results**  
  Amanda carefully tracked her conversion rates at every step of her strategy. This data-driven approach allowed her to refine her system and feel confident in the drastic changes she implemented. Leadpages’ built-in tools made this process simple and effective.
