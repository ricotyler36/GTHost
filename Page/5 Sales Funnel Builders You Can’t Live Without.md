### Understanding Sales Funnels

In simple terms, a **sales funnel** represents the journey a potential customer takes from their first interaction with your business to making a purchase. Itâ€™s called a funnel because it starts with a large number of visitors at the top and narrows down to actual buyers at the bottom.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

- **Step 1:** People enter your funnel through a landing page where they share their contact details.
- **Step 2:** They receive emails or other valuable content to build trust.
- **Step 3:** They start to like and trust your brand.
- **Step 4:** They eventually buy your products or services.

Sales funnels are a way to automate and streamline this process, helping you save time and boost profits. Without a sales funnel, you risk losing potential customers forever.

- **Automate follow-ups** with email sequences.
