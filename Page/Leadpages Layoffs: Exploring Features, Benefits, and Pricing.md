## Key Features of Leadpages

### LeadBoxes
One standout feature is **LeadBoxes**, a customizable popup tool. These popups can be triggered by user actions like clicking a button, text, or image. LeadBoxes are particularly effective for capturing leads and can even be timed to appear after a set duration or when a visitor is about to leave your page (Exit Intent). This targeted approach helps convert both organic and paid traffic into actionable leads.

### Built-In Ad Creation
Leadpages allows you to create Facebook and Instagram ads directly within the platform. This feature is fully automated, saving you time while optimizing your ad spend. Leadpages pulls content directly from your landing pages, enabling you to create polished ads quickly. Additionally, a Facebook Pixel is automatically added to your landing pages for retargeting and tracking.

### Split Testing
Split testing is a crucial feature for marketers looking to optimize conversions. Leadpages allows users to test multiple variations of their landing pages side-by-side to determine which version performs best. By comparing conversion rates, you can fine-tune your campaigns for maximum impact.

### Integrations
Leadpages integrates seamlessly with a wide range of marketing and sales tools, including email marketing platforms like Mailchimp, CRM tools, and even Shopify. These integrations allow you to automate processes, such as adding leads to email lists or creating a smooth shopping experience with buy buttons and shopping carts.
